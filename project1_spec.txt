                    Project Description 
                    In this project, you will design and implement a browser-based control interface for a 
                    physical robot. A user will control the robot from a phone or laptop by connecting directly 
                    to the robot’s IP address. 
                    The system architecture is: 
                    Web Browser (HTML/JS) → Flask Server (on Pi) → Robot Control Code (Python) 
                    This project emphasizes human–robot interaction, system integration, and reliability, 
                    not autonomy. 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    Required System Capabilities 
                    1. Hardware Bring-Up & Verification (Step A – Required) 
                    Before any web control: 
                    You must demonstrate that the following components work from Python code: 
                         •    Drive wheels 
                         •    Head tilt 
                         •    Head pan 
                         •    Waist rotation 
                         •    Any broken items must be replaced and fixed before going on.  
                    Arms: 
                         •    Must be tested and verified 
                         •    Not required to be controlled via the web interface 
                         •    Need to know what’s broken so you can fix later, not for this project. 
                    Deliverable: 
                         •    A short Python script (or module) that individually exercises wheels, head and waist. 
                         •    You can use the Maestro Control  
                         •    Clear indication of directions and limits 
                    This step exists to separate hardware problems from software problems. 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    2. Robot Control Layer (Python – Required) 
                    You must implement a control layer that: 
                         •    Exposes functions for: 
                                   o    Driving (forward/back/turn via wheel speeds) 
                                   o    Head tilt 
                                   o    Head pan 
                                   o    Waist rotation 
                         •    Enforces safe limits on motion 
                         •    Has a clearly defined STOP / neutral state 
                    This layer: 
                         •    Must be independent of Flask 
                         •    Must be callable directly from Python for testing 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    3. Flask Control Server (Required) 
                    A Flask server running on the robot must: 
                         •    Serve the HTML/JavaScript page 
                                   o    You run >>python myApp.py 
                                   o    And then use http://<robot-ip>:YourPortNumber/   
                                   o    And flask will serve the Webpage, Flask will serve as the webserver.  
                                   o    (Remember you can use A.I. to show you how flask can host the Webpage.  
                         •    Accept control commands from the webpage 
                         •    Forward validated commands to the robot control layer 
                    Requirements: 
                         •    Flask runs on the robot 
                         •    HTML/JS files are hosted by Flask 
                         •    No external cloud services 
                         •    System works entirely on the local network 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    4. Web Control Interface (HTML / JavaScript – Required) 
                    Users must be able to connect by visiting: 
                    http://<robot-ip-address>:<port> 
                    The webpage must provide: 
                    Drive Control 
                         •    A joystick (mouse or touch-based) 
                         •    Controls left/right wheel motion proportionally 
                    Head Control 
                         •    Sliders for: 
                                   o    Tilt 
                                   o    Pan 
                    Voice Output 
                         •    At least four predefined phrases 
                         •    Triggered by buttons on the webpage 
                    Example phrases (students may customize): 
                         •    “Hello, Hunter.” 
                         •    “Hunter is so cool.” 
                         •    “Please do not touch my wheels.” 
                         •    “Hunter is the greatest.” 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    5. Data Flow & Validation (Required) 
                    You must demonstrate and document: 
                         •    What data is sent from the browser 
                         •    How it is validated on the server 
                         •    How it is translated into motor commands 
                    Invalid or unsafe commands must: 
                         •    Be rejected 
                         •    Not move the robot 
                                                                                                                                                     
                    6. Failure Awareness & Safety (Required) 
                    Your system must handle at least three of the following: 
                         •    Page refresh while robot is moving 
                         •    Lost network connection 
                         •    Invalid joystick values 
                         •    Rapid command flooding 
                         •    Flask server restart 
                    At minimum: 
                         •    Robot must stop safely 
                         •    System must not crash silently
